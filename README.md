    hello! ü§ç

My name is Chloe, and I'm an 18-year-old developer from Canada. I'm interested in game development, as well as low level development and cybersecurity. I'm most comfortable in Java, C, and C++, and I'm working on learning Rust.

Some notable projects of mine:
- **[Aulavik](https://github.com/niqumu/Aulavik)**, a tiny POSIX-like kernel written in C
- **[nadeshiko](https://nadeshiko.io)**, a modern Hypixel stats viewer
- **Runic Realms**, a 1.21 Minecraft RPG inspired by Runescape and Terraria 
- A **Hypixel SkyBlock clone** with damage calculation, skills, stats, and more

I've been programming since I was in elementary school, having began to take it more seriously over COVID-19, where I picked up my interests in both game development and kernel development. I'm also interested in graphic design and the artistic side of development, having taken three years of formal education in the field.

Outside of programming, I enjoy music, photography, and learning new things.
